# Hotel Booking Astra Theme Integration Addon

This extension allows you to link the [MotoPress Hotel Booking plugin](https://motopress.com/products/hotel-booking/) with the popular Astra theme to add more customization flexibility when you use them together.

This custom-crafted addon is made to help you achieve a better look of the content sourced by the MotoPress Hotel Booking plugin in Astra: it smoothly adjusts Hotel Booking to the default Astra styling.

In particular, itâ€™ll improve the spacing of the search and booking forms, the output of the property search results, and the styling of the Hotel Booking Reviews addon. This extension also offers list and grid layout options for accommodations directory.

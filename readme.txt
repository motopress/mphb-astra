Build your property rental website with MotoPress Hotel Booking plugin shortcodes and Astra theme.

== Description ==

This custom-crafted addon is made to help you achieve a better look of the MotoPress Hotel Booking plugin in the free Astra theme: it smoothly adjusts Hotel Booking to the default Astra styling. In particular, itâ€™ll improve the spacing of the search and booking forms, the output of the property search results, and the styling of the Hotel Booking Reviews addon. This extension also offers list and grid layout options for the bookable properties.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the MotoPress plugin to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
